# polymer-intro

An intro to Web Components and Polymer 1.0.

Running the sample apps:
- `cd` into the app directory and run `gulp serve` (gulp will automatically open a tab in your default browser)
- for Firefox:
  - enable web components for `hello-world-wc` (see [Enabling Web Components in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components#Enabling_Web_Components_in_Firefox))
  - disable web components for `hello-world` (Polymer already uses the polyfills)

gulpfiles adapted from [this gulp + BrowserSync recipe](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/server-with-livereload-and-css-injection.md)
